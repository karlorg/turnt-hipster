A silly thing I'm playing with.  Not something the general public should look at unless you want a laugh at the horrible coder.

* Things

I hope you have a USB Xbox 360 controller or use QWERTY.  Keyboard controls are WASD, which is a stretch for Colemak users and I don't even know where Dvorak puts those.

Next big problem is how to do collision detection in an entity system.  To do it 'right' we really should account for cases where the player has moved a long distance in a single frame and might have skipped over a dot, but unless we incorporate the collision detection into the player movement system, we'll have to communicate the player's movement to the collision system somehow.  Maybe the MovesInMaze component or the (not yet existing) Collides component should have fields for recording the previous position?

Could probably fake it by looking at the player's facing direction and position and inferring whether they've crossed a dot this frame, assuming the player never moves more than half a square in one frame.  We might enforce that anyway by capping the dt for each frame at .6 or something, ie. if frame rate drops below 10fps the action slows down.
